I love seeing my notifications go off, so please if you like something hit that love button. Feel free to comment too! I love feedback 🥰

💚 I will spam green hearts everywhere 💚

I'm putting myself out there. I've been a hermit for too long and need human contact. This year I'm putting in the effort to socialise and meet people. I want to explore and experience. I want to do things with people. I want to have conversations. 

I'm interested in the pretty, the colourful, the unusual, the bright and shiny. I'm attracted to honesty, openness, self-awareness, critical thinking, and logic. I love the low-key, the chill, the comfy, the relaxed. 

Let it be fun.

I read bios writings and status. Thank you for reading mine 🥰
There's more of me to see but you need to be my friend first 🥹
This is so I can be sure I'm not waving it about in someone's face who doesn't want to see it. So if you're not a fan of… umm… raw sausages… that's really the only thing behind that friend button 💚

I'm open to receiving friend requests, but I won't presume to send you one. Unless you've made it clear you want one 😅

If we haven't talked, flirted, and made it clear there's chemistry and consent, I won't be using your content for enjoyment, and it's certainly not as fun when you're not involved in some way. 

I'm honestly not all that fussed about what equipment you're working with, what body you're in, or how you identify. A person is a person, and if I can get to know them and find some chemistry then fun times surely aren't too far away. My taste in people's appearance really only comes down to what tickles my brain when I look at them. Different people will tickle me in different ways. 

If any of my interactions are unwelcomed, unappreciated, or unwanted, please do not hesitate to let me know and i shall promptly amend my behaviour 💚 i do my best but nobody is perfect and i still makes mistakes sometimes. at the very least i hope to learn from them 🥰

I'm not into one night stands or anonymous sex, I'm gonna need to get to know you. Your personality will make me hard a lot quicker than your body. So let that shine through. If all you're after is some quick action then I'm not the guy your looking for.
